# Programs on File handling in C
## What is File Handling in C ?
File handling refers to the method of storing data in the C program in the form of an output or input that might have been generated while running a C program in a data file, i.e., a binary file or a text file for future analysis and reference in that very program.
## What are Binary files ?
The binary files store info and data in the binary format of 0’s and 1’s (the binary number system). Thus, the files occupy comparatively lesser space in the storage. In simpler words, the binary files store data and info the same way a computer holds the info in its memory. Thus, it can be accessed very easily as compared to a text file.

The binary files are created with the extension .bin in a program, and it overcomes the drawback of the text files in a program since humans can’t read it; only machines can. Thus, the information becomes much more secure. Thus, binary files are safest in terms of storing data files in a C program.

## What is the difference between text and binary files?
We create the text files using an extension .txt with the help of a simple text editor. The binary files store info and data in the binary format of 0’s and 1’s (the binary number system). The binary files are created with the extension .bin in a program, and it overcomes the drawback of the text files in a program.

## How to Install

1. Create a ```C``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/AdityaSeth777/ES-CS291_Practice.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory ``` cd Program 14 ```.
4. Run ``` pip3 install gcc ```.
5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.  

## Usage
- To run any program (without <math.h>), run ``` gcc filename.c -o name```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute; name = output executable file.
- Then type ``` ./name```, and then press Enter to execute successfully.

## FAQ
- How to stop the script? Ctrl+C (control+C for Mac) 
- For any other problems, feel free to raise an issue.
