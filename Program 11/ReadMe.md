# Tower of Hanoi Program in C
## What is the Tower of Hanoi ?
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of a minimum of 3 rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to the last rod, obeying the following rules:

1. Only one disk may be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.

## How to Install

1. Create a ```C``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/AdityaSeth777/ES-CS291_Practice.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory ``` cd Program 11 ```.
4. Run ``` pip3 install gcc ```.
5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.  

## Usage
- To run any program (without <math.h>), run ``` gcc filename.c -o name```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute; name = output executable file.
- Then type ``` ./name```, and then press Enter to execute successfully.

## FAQ
