## What is a Factorial ?
The factorial function of a positive integer n is defined by the product of all positive integers not greater than n.
Mathematical Representation = ```n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1.```
## What is GCD ?
In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. 
## What is Combination Co-efficient Generation ?

## What is a Fibonacci number ?
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fâ‚™, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors omit the initial terms and start the sequence from 1 and 1 or from 1 and 2.

## How to Install

1. Create a ```C``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/AdityaSeth777/ES-CS291_Practice.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory ``` cd Program 10 ```.
4. Run ``` pip3 install gcc ```.
5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.  

## Usage
- To run any program (without <math.h>), run ``` gcc filename.c -o name```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute; name = output executable file.
- Then type ``` ./name```, and then press Enter to execute successfully.

## FAQ
- How to stop the script? Ctrl+C (control+C for Mac) 
- For any other problems, feel free to raise an issue.
