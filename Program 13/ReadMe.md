## What is a structure ?
A struct in the C programming language is a composite data type declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables under one name in a block of memory, allowing the different variables to be accessed via a single pointer or by the struct declared name which returns the same address.
```A structure is used in this program.```
## How to Install
